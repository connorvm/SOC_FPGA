Alex
Opcodes 100-111
100 - Decrement B
101 - R = A
110 - Swap A & B
111 - A AND B = R C reg will be a invert flag

Connor
Opcodes 000-011
000 - Nop
001 - A ADD B = R
010 - A SUB B = R
011 - A MUL B = R


JUST A FEW THINGS WE to do next 

We need to make a qsys_alu
	in this we need to
--	1 hook up the LEDs to the ALU through the SW  **I think is done**
-	2 set up component in Platform Desiger

OTHERS:
1)We need to write the c code
	>Run program on bootup with systemd
	>Output information with format
2)Write report
3)
