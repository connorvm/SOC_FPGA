Alex
Opcodes 100-111
100 - Decrement B
101 - R = A
110 - Swap A & B
111 - A AND B = R C reg will be a invert flag

Opcodes 000-011
000 - Nop
001 - A ADD B = R
010 - A SUB B = R
011 - A MUL B = R


JUST A FEW THINGS WE to do next 

We need to make a qsys_alu
	in this we need to
	1 hook up the LEDs to the ALU through the SW  **I think is done**
	2 set up component in Platform Desiger

We need to adjust the LED_control to either run the way we want or through it out

we need to alos write the c code
